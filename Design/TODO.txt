Economy
	Test if vendors can take gold coins only for items instead of credits
		Also see if ingots can be taken
	Make gold coins heavy
	Recipe to turn coins back into ingots
	
Death
	Test to see if a memory cell can be spawned in the death bag
	Test to detect when the death bag despawns
		On death bag despawn, spawn a new bag with memory cell
	Have the mod move the player's save data while "dead" similar to how the permanent death mod works
		What to do with ships / property in the interim?
	Need to create a way to "use" the player's memory cell at a cloner
		This would cause the mod to move the player's save data back
	What to do with dead players logging in?
Shipyards
	See if a mod can spawn a ship from a blueprint
	See if ownership can be granted to a player
	Already have a way to do payment (look at clanwars mod)
State
	Figure out a good way to save / load state
		Dead players, ships in progress, mantle resources etc
